    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the average price changes 
    of a fixed basket of consumption goods and services commonly purchased by the 
    resident households over time. It is widely used as a measure of consumer price 
    inflation and a proxy for the cost of living in a country.

  description: "The dataset was acquired from <a target='_blank' href='https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/economy/prices-and-price-indices/latest-data'>Singstat</a>.It contains 8 tabs of data, containing information ranging from average retail prices to Consumer Price Index changes across time. The time period analysed was between 2012 to 2021."
  content: '<p class="lead">
    In order to visualise the changes effectively, a multi-pronged approach was considered, starting with descriptive analysis of the dataset by showing the CPI as well as the price changes for different item divisions. This will be conducted using line charts, box plots, sunburst charts as well as horizon graphs.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Next, correlation analysis was conducted between different item divisions, in order to glean any insights of any potential correlations between them. Seasonality analysis was also conducted in order to see if certain items experience regular and predicted changes in prices (seasonal) over time.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Lastly, predictive analysis was conducted on the historical data provided, in order to forecast future price changes in different items. This was conducted by employing a plethora of models such as ARIMA, ETS, TSLM and autoregressive models.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    We hope that through our app, the general public would be able to keep up-to-date on the latest price changes of various items, as well as use our app to forecast future price changes and make better, informed decisions for their future.
